For this group review, we will explore the [Simpsons Dataset from Kaggle](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/readme.md) by Prashant Banerjee. Follow the linked instructions from the tidytuesday repository to load and explore the data.

You will generate at least two visualizations that will answer the following questions:

1.  What are the most frequently used locations in the series, and do specific locations correspond to higher IMDb ratings for episodes?
2.  Is there a relationship between the number of U.S. viewers (in millions) and the IMDb ratings or votes for episodes?

The approach to answering these questions is completely up to you - it could be a static `ggplot()`, an interactive `plotly`, a `shiny` app, or a `gt` or `reactable` table. Be creative!

Use what you have learned so far in the R for Data Science text. Explore the use of color, geoms, annotations, labels, and text. And remember, [above all else show the data](https://martinez-jorge.quarto.pub/show-the-data/)!
